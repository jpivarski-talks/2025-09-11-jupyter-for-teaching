## How to participate

We will start with [1-introduction.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpivarski-talks/2025-09-11-jupyter-for-teaching/main/1-introduction.pdf) and then launch Jupyter through Docker and make:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jpivarski-talks/2025-09-11-jupyter-for-teaching.git
cd 2025-09-11-jupyter-for-teaching
make run
```

When you see a message like this in your terminal:

```
    To access the server, copy and paste this URL:
        http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=41a27XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

open that URL in a web browser.
